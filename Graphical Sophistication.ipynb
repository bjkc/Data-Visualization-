We can see only two picture of frog in a graph, however, it lacks necessary label and crucial information. As we can see there is a gap betweem `May` and `September`, what was the size of frog around `Jun` and `July`? Infact, it is hard to tell from the graph. Here the graph fails to do great job in presenting its intention clearly in the first place.  \n",

The title says the number of frogs, but all I can see is one frog in each month. The graph is not relevant at all. Also, In the `x-axis`, `May` and `September` is not differentiated properly. Instead of using frog it would have been appropriate to use a bar graph have made more sense. It is crystal clear that it has lot of issues of clarity of data pattern, labels, limited information and so on. \n",

Also, in the above graph the title holds strong relationship between three types of policies. And the graph with different types of policy elaborates efficiently. Starting with `Current` which a person can know easily about their on going policy and at the same time they can compare it with `Alternative A` and `Alternative B`. As a customer if an agent present this graph to me I think I will be clear just by looking at it. \n",

In this graph it is stated clearly that it has both axis labeled appropriately. It also has a source mentioned in it. In fact, all the units of variable measured are defined. With in a data it does comparison of two variable `Beneficiary` and `Non-beneficiary`. Bar graph is a good form to use in this case and I could not provide with other standard forms. \n",
