        "From the above graph we can tell that the size of frog in `May` is smaller than size of frog from `September`. But what is its message? By putting only two picture of frog is not enough to send the message to the readers. There is a gap betweem may and september, what was the size of frog around `Jun` and `July`? It is hard to tell from the graph. Here the graph fails to do great job in presenting its intention clearly at first place.  \n",

The title ssays the number of frogs, but all I can see is one frog in each month. In the `x-axis`, May and September is not differentiated properly. It is not a clear graph either. Instead of using frog it would have been appropriate to use bar graph, have made more sense. It is crystal clear that it has lot of issues of clarity of datas pattern, labels, limited information and so on. \n",

Starting with `Current` which a person can know easily about their on going policy and at the same time they can compare it with `Alternative A` and `Alternative B`.

With in a data it does comparison of two variable `Beneficiary` and `Non-beneficiary`. Bar graph is a good form to use in this case and I could not provide with other standard forms. \n",
